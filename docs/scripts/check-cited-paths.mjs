// Assert every repo path the docs cite in backticks actually exists.
//
// This is the guard against the largest class of documentation drift: prose
// that names a file or directory the code has since moved or renamed. Nothing
// caught it before, because a stale path breaks no build and no link checker
// looks inside a code span. `guide/testing.md` and `operations/adding-a-law.md`
// both told readers for months that BDD features live in `features/`, a
// directory that does not exist, and pointed at
// `packages/engine/tests/bdd/steps/`, which does not either. A reader following
// those pages wrote a file that could not run.
//
// It reads the markdown, not the build output, so it runs without `astro build`
// and fails fast. Non-zero exit fails the gate.
//
// ## What counts as a cited path
//
// A backtick span is treated as a repo path when it looks like one: at least
// one slash, no spaces, no URL scheme, and a first segment that could be a
// directory name. Everything else in backticks (field names, commands, YAML
// keys, operations) is ignored. That leaves roughly 95 candidates out of some
// 1000 code spans in the docs.
//
// ## Why a suffix match, not an exact one
//
// A path is accepted when it matches the tail of any tracked file, so
// `src/main.js` in a page about the editor resolves against
// `frontend/src/main.js`. Docs legitimately write paths relative to the
// component they describe, and demanding repo-root paths everywhere would make
// the prose worse to read in order to satisfy a script.
//
// The cost is real and deliberate: a path whose basename exists somewhere else
// in the repo passes even when the directory it names is wrong. That trade buys
// a false-positive rate low enough for a blocking gate, which is the property
// that decides whether a check survives. A gate people learn to ignore protects
// nothing.
//
// ## Why an allowlist rather than a cleverer pattern
//
// The remaining non-paths are not a pattern, they are a list: fictional
// organizations in examples, media types that look like paths, git refs,
// external systems. Each entry below says why it is there. An allowlist that
// has to be read and justified stays honest; a regex broad enough to swallow
// them silently would also swallow the next real defect.
