/*
 * Put the landing page's runtime assets in place before the site is built.
 *
 * The run panel executes the zorgtoeslag scenario in the visitor's browser, so
 * the build needs the laws, the scenario and the canonical-grammar runner
 * inside this project. script/landing-laws.sh assembles them out of the
 * repository; this wrapper is what `npm run build` calls, so that every way of
 * building the site gets them: CI's accessibility gate, the Docker image, and a
 * plain `npm run build` on a laptop.
 *
 * Wiring it here rather than in each of those places is the point. The assets
 * are gitignored build products, and a job that builds without them fails on a
 * missing import, which is exactly how the accessibility gate broke: it ran
 * `astro build` in a fresh checkout where docs/src/lib/gherkin did not exist.
 *
 * Two situations are not errors:
 *   - the image has already run the script, with the repository laid out
 *     differently (/app and /corpus), so the assets are there and the corpus is
 *     not where a checkout would have it;
 *   - someone builds the docs from a copy of docs/ alone.
 * Both are recognised by the assets already being present. Anything else fails
 * loudly: a site that builds without them is a site whose run panel is broken.
