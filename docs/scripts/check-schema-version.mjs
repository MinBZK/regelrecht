// places (a "current version is vX.Y.Z" line, an immutable-tag example URL,
// and the top row of the Version History table), and renders the rest of the
// page from a committed snapshot of the schema, which is the fourth thing
// checked here. None of them are derived from the repo at build time, so the
// page silently rots the moment `schema/latest` is bumped and
// nobody edits the doc: it then advertises an old version as current while
// looking authoritative, and law authors copy a stale `$schema` URL. This
// check makes CI fail when the page falls behind `schema/latest`, so the
// versioned schema and its documentation can never drift apart again.
//
// It reads source files only (the `schema/latest` symlink + the markdown), not
// the astro build, so it runs without `astro build`. The `schema/` tree lives
// outside docs/ and is not in the docs Docker build context, but it IS present
// in the CI repo checkout where this script runs (see the provenance-checks
// job). Non-zero exit fails the gate.

// 5. The tag the page advertises must exist. The URL in `$schema` is a

//    they validated against stays fetchable at that address. Shape alone is
//    not enough: the corpus check elsewhere matches `$schema` against the
//    local `schema/vX.Y.Z` directories, so a version that was released in the
//    tree but never tagged passes every existing gate while its published URL
//    404s. That is how five versions shipped untagged (v0.5.7 through v0.7.0),
//    leaving eleven corpus files citing an address that returned a 404. They
//    have since been tagged; this check is what keeps the next one from
//    slipping out the same way.
//
//    This blocks. Tagging is the step that makes a released version immutable:
//    without a tag the `$schema` URL resolves to nothing, and nothing stops the
//    file being edited afterwards, so "a published version is never modified"
//    holds by convention rather than by construction. A release is not finished
//    until its tag exists.
//
//    Tags are only present in a checkout that fetched them, so a missing tag
//    list is not evidence of a missing tag: skip when there are none at all
//    rather than fail a shallow clone. Use `fetch-depth: 0` in CI, or fetch the
//    tags locally, to make this check meaningful.
//
//    A version that is being released right now has no tag yet, and cannot
//    have one: `.github/workflows/tag-schema.yml` sets it on the push to main,
//    because a tag on a pull request's test merge would point at a commit that
//    never becomes main. So a version counts as released, and must be tagged,
//    only once it is on main and was already there before the commit under
//    test. That is "present at origin/main" (a pull request, the merge queue,
//    a local branch) and "present at HEAD^" (the push to main that releases
//    it, where tag-schema runs in parallel with this check). A version
//    missing from either is the release in progress.
