description: "The Vue 3 law editor: the corpus browser, trajects with their werkdocumenten and tasks, the split-pane editor, and the harvester dashboard."
---

The editor is a Vue 3 single-page app in `frontend/`. It browses the corpus, holds the traject workspace (laws, werkdocumenten, tasks, members), edits laws in a split-pane editor with scenarios running on the engine as WASM, and hosts the harvester dashboard.

## Overview

- **Framework**: Vue 3 (Composition API), Vue Router
- **Build tool**: Vite 8
- **Design system**: [@nldd/design-system](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nldd/design-system) web components
- **Backend**: [editor-api](./editor-api), which also serves the built app
- **Location**: `frontend/`

## Routes and pages

`src/router.js` is the map. `App.vue` is only a `<router-view>`; the real structure is one persistent shell, `AppShell.vue`, with the Home and Editor sections as its children, plus a handful of top-level pages that carry their own title bar instead of the app chrome.

### The shell

`AppShell.vue` holds the chrome that survives a switch between sections: the Home/Editor tab bar, the search field (a button below the `lg` breakpoint), the "+" menu, the traject menu and the account menu. Switching tabs swaps only the nested `<router-view>`, so the chrome is not rebuilt. In the editor the shell also renders the document tab bar of open articles, and a "PR #N" link to the pull request that the last save in the traject wrote to.

- **"+" menu**: inside a traject it offers *Wet toevoegen*, *Werkdocument toevoegen* (new or upload) and *Leden uitnodigen*. Logged out, the same button opens a prompt to log in or request an account.
- **Traject menu** (`TrajectMenu.vue`, `MobileTrajectSheet.vue` on small screens): switch traject or go to the traject chooser.
- **Account menu**: log in or out, *Account aanvragen*, the color scheme (*Weergave*), *Instellingen*, *Harvester* for users with a harvester role, *Over RegelRecht* and *Help*.

The editor tab requires a login. Every route marked `requiresAuth` waits for `/auth/status` before it mounts; a user without a session goes to `/uitgelogd`, which keeps the intended destination in `return_url` for the log-in button.

### Home

Every Home route renders `LibraryView.vue`, which uses a navigation split view: a primary sidebar, a secondary sidebar and a main pane. What the panes show depends on the route.

| Route | What it shows |
|-------|---------------|
| `/` | The public corpus (*Corpus juris*). The sidebar lists *Favorieten* and *Recent bekeken*. |
| `/corpus-juris/{lawId}/{article?}` | A law from the public corpus: articles in the secondary sidebar, the article in main with *Tekst*, *Machine* and *YAML* tabs. |
| `/trajecten/{ref}` | The traject landing. The sidebar adds *Instellingen*, *Werkdocumenten* and *Taken*, and the section *In dit traject*. |
| `/trajecten/{ref}/corpus/{lawId}/{article?}` | A law as the traject has it, read through `/api/trajects/{ref}/corpus/...`. |
| `/trajecten/{ref}/werkdocumenten/{docPath?}` | The traject's werkdocumenten: the document list in the secondary sidebar, the Markdown editor in main. |
| `/trajecten/{ref}/instellingen/{details\|leden}` | Traject settings: *Algemeen* (name, description, status, your role; delete or leave) and *Leden* (members, roles, pending invites). |
| `/trajecten/{ref}/structuur-controle` | The *Algemeen* settings pane with the structure report open as a sheet over it. |
| `/trajecten/{ref}/taken/{categorie?}/{lawId?}` | The user's tasks in the traject, by category. |

A traject ref has the form `{slug}-{8 hex}`. The router pins that pattern in every traject route, and law `$id`s use underscores, so a law id can never be read as a traject ref.

**Werkdocumenten** are Markdown documents stored in the traject's own repository, under `documents/{ref}/`. A new one opens empty in the editor. An upload is converted to Markdown by a pipeline job; before it starts, a confirmation step asks whether a language model may be used for the conversion. Conversions still running show above the document list, and a failed one becomes a task.

**Taken** lists open tasks under *Prioriteit*, *Wachten op* and *Alle taken*, plus one entry per law that tasks refer to. Tasks come from pipeline jobs started for the traject: a harvest, an enrichment or a document conversion ends in a review task, and a job that fails leaves a failure task. A task never opens in the main pane itself; *Beoordelen* goes to the editor or the werkdocument it concerns.

**Structuurcontrole** (`TrajectIntegrityPane.vue`) reports what is wrong with how the traject corpus is laid out, with a remedy per finding. The case that prompted it: the law index reads a law id from the directory name, while the editor switches to the `$id` in the YAML after loading, and when those differ everything after it fails with "not found". The report loads on opening and on *Opnieuw controleren*, not periodically.

**Members** have one of two roles, *Beheerder* (owner) or *Bijdrager* (contributor). An owner changes roles and removes members; the last owner cannot be demoted. Invites go through `InviteMembersSheet.vue`, reachable from the members pane and the "+" menu.

### Editor

`/trajecten/{ref}/editor/{lawId?}/{article?}` renders `EditorView.vue`. There is no editor outside a traject: `/editor`, the old `/editor/{lawId}` links and `/editor.html` all redirect to the traject chooser, carrying the law along so it opens after the choice.

The editor is a side-by-side split view with one pane per view. Each pane has a menu to switch its view and to move it left or right. The pane layout is kept in `localStorage`.

| View | Content |
|------|---------|
| *Tekst* | The article text, editable for users with write access, with a formatting toolbar (bold, italic, list type). Selecting text starts a note. |
| *Machine* | The `machine_readable` section as a structured view. `EditSheet.vue` and `ActionSheet.vue` edit definitions, inputs, outputs and actions. |
| *Scenario's* | `ScenarioBuilder.vue`: the law's Gherkin scenarios, run in the browser. Per scenario, *Resultaat* opens the execution trace and *Graaf* the cross-law graph with the trace laid over it (`LawGraphView.vue`). |
| *YAML* | The raw YAML in a code editor. A parse error shows under it; if the engine refuses the YAML, a banner says so above the panes. |
| *Notities* | All notes on the article, and the drafts that have not been saved yet. |

A law without a `machine_readable` section shows an empty state in *Machine* and *YAML*, with the option to request enrichment or start writing by hand.

### Top-level pages

| Route | Page |
|-------|------|
| `/trajecten` | `TrajectChooserView.vue`: pick a traject or create one. `?sectie=` and `?law=`/`?article=` carry the intended destination. |
| `/editor/nieuw-traject` | `TrajectCreateView.vue`: the form for a new traject. |
| `/account-aanvragen` | `AccountRequestView.vue`: a public page on who can get an account and how. |
| `/uitgelogd` | `SessionExpiredView.vue`: the public landing after a session ends. |
| `/harvesting/...` | The harvester dashboard; see [Corpusinwinning](#corpusinwinning-harvester-dashboard) below. |

Older paths (`/library/...`, `/corpus-juris`, `/werkdocumenten/{ref}/...`) redirect to their current equivalents.

### Instellingen

The settings sheet (`SettingsSheet.vue`, from the account menu) has two sections, and the menu item disappears when neither applies:

- **Koppelingen**: link or unlink a personal GitHub account, shown when the deployment has a GitHub OAuth app and writes require a personal token.
- **Beheer**, for the `editor-admin` role: the feature-flag switches below, and the switch that makes writes require a personal GitHub account. These settings apply to every user of the deployment.

## Feature flags

Flags are deployment-wide, stored in the `feature_flags` table and served by `GET /api/feature-flags`. `PUT /api/feature-flags/{key}` is behind the `editor-admin` role. The frontend keeps its own defaults in `src/composables/useFeatureFlags.js` so it can render before the API answers.

The list in `packages/editor-api/src/feature_flags.rs` is also the allow-list: the backend rejects a PUT for a key it does not know with 400, and the frontend then reverts the switch. The two lists therefore have to name the same keys.

| Key | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `panel.article_text` | on | Offers the *Tekst* pane in the editor. |
| `panel.machine_readable` | on | Offers the *Machine* pane. |
| `panel.scenario_form` | on | Offers the *Scenario's* pane. |
| `panel.yaml_editor` | on | Offers the *YAML* pane. |
| `panel.notes` | on | Offers the *Notities* pane. |
| `github.user_oauth` | off | Traject writes require the acting user's own GitHub token, and the settings sheet offers linking a GitHub account. The `GITHUB_USER_TOKEN_REQUIRED` environment variable can force this on regardless of the flag. |

Turning a `panel.*` flag off removes that pane from the editor; turning it back on adds it again. Other users see the change on their next page load.

When the backend has no database, the PUT returns 503 and the frontend keeps the change in `localStorage`. In a development setup without OIDC a failed write is also kept locally, so the panes stay switchable.

## Data loading

Law content comes from the editor-api. `src/composables/corpusUrls.js` builds every corpus URL in one of two shapes: `/api/corpus/...` for the public corpus (read-only) and `/api/trajects/{ref}/corpus/...` inside a traject (read and write). `useLaw.js` loads a law with a `GET` on that URL and saves it with a `PUT`. A save in a traject is written back to the traject's repository; the response carries the pull request it went to, which is where the "PR #N" link comes from.

Scenarios run on the engine compiled to WASM, loaded by `useEngine.js` from the WASM package that `just wasm-build` writes into the app's public directory.

The `scripts/copy-laws.js` step still runs before `dev` and `build`. It copies local corpus files and the note vocabulary into a `data` folder in the app's public directory; the app reads only the ambiguity vocabulary from there at runtime.

## Design system

The UI is built from `@nldd/design-system` web components (element prefix `nldd-`). `src/main.js` imports `src/nldd-components.js`, a generated list with one entry point per component the app renders, plus the design system's styles. `script/check-nldd-imports.mjs` keeps that list in step with the tags in the source, so a newly used component fails the build rather than silently missing. A representative slice:

| Category | Components used |
|----------|----------------|
| **Layout** | `nldd-app-view`, `nldd-bar-split-view`, `nldd-navigation-split-view`, `nldd-side-by-side-split-view`, `nldd-page`, `nldd-toolbar`, `nldd-container` |
| **Navigation** | `nldd-top-title-bar`, `nldd-tab-bar`, `nldd-document-tab-bar`, `nldd-menu` |
| **Inputs** | `nldd-search-field`, `nldd-text-field`, `nldd-multi-line-text-field`, `nldd-dropdown`, `nldd-combo-box`, `nldd-segmented-control`, `nldd-switch` |
| **Lists & cells** | `nldd-list`, `nldd-list-item`, `nldd-text-cell`, `nldd-icon-cell`, `nldd-collection` |
| **Actions & overlays** | `nldd-button`, `nldd-icon-button`, `nldd-button-group`, `nldd-inline-dialog`, `nldd-modal-dialog`, `nldd-sheet` |
| **Content** | `nldd-rich-text`, `nldd-code-viewer`, `nldd-code-editor`, `nldd-title`, `nldd-tag` |

App-level CSS is small. `frontend/css/main.css` holds a few resets and the `--color-primary` token (`#154273`). Two feature stylesheets sit next to their code: `src/harvester/harvester.css` for the dashboard and `src/components/graph/graph-styles.css` for the law graph.

## Vue components

Besides the views in `src/` (`AppShell.vue`, `LibraryView.vue`, `EditorView.vue` and the top-level pages), `src/components/` holds 40 components. The ones that carry most of the behavior:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ArticleText.vue` / `ArticleTextEditor.vue` | Render and edit article text |
| `MachineReadable.vue` / `MachineEmptyState.vue` | Machine-readable view, and the empty state with enrichment |
| `EditSheet.vue` / `ActionSheet.vue` / `OperationSettings.vue` | Editing definitions, actions and operations |
| `ScenarioBuilder.vue` / `ScenarioForm.vue` | Scenario list and authoring |
| `ExecutionTraceView.vue` / `LawGraphView.vue` (+ `graph/`) | Execution trace and cross-law graph |
| `NoteCreator.vue` / `NoteCard.vue` | Stand-off notes (RFC-018) |
| `DocumentList.vue` / `DocumentEditor.vue` | Werkdocumenten |
| `TasksCategoriesPane.vue` / `TasksListPane.vue` | Taken |
| `TrajectDetailsPane.vue` / `TrajectMembersPane.vue` / `TrajectIntegrityPane.vue` | Traject settings and the structure report |
| `SearchPopover.vue` / `AddLawSheet.vue` | Finding a law, and adding one to a traject: copied from the central corpus, harvested by BWB id, or converted from an uploaded PDF or DOCX |

Shared state and API calls live in composables under `src/composables/`, most of them module-level singletons (`useTrajects.js`, `useTasks.js`, `useFeatureFlags.js` and others).

## Corpusinwinning (harvester dashboard)

The harvester dashboard is a section of this app, in `frontend/src/harvester/`. It reaches the standalone [Admin](./admin) API through the editor-api proxy at `/api/harvest-admin/*`, which forwards the session cookie so the admin service applies its own role checks. `packages/admin/` serves no frontend of its own.

The route `/harvesting` requires one of `harvester-reader`, `harvester-writer`, `harvester-admin` or `regelrecht-admin`; a logged-in user without one goes back to `/`. The entry point is *Harvester* in the account menu. The dashboard has its own title bar with a back button that returns to where the user came from, and a button for a new harvest job.

| Tab | Route | Content |
|-----|-------|---------|
| *Overzicht* | `/harvesting/overview` | Totals, a status breakdown and daily chart per job type, and recent failures |
| *Wetten* | `/harvesting/law-entries` | Per law its status and coverage, with actions to harvest, enrich, or reset a law whose retries are exhausted |
| *Taken* | `/harvesting/jobs` | The job queue, grouped per law or as a flat list (`?view=flat`), with a detail sheet per job |
| *Markeringen* | `/harvesting/markings` | Markings that enrichment left in the corpus: places where a construct could not be expressed. Grouped into clusters by the change that would resolve them (a format change or an operation); selecting a cluster filters the list. |
| *Untranslatables* | `/harvesting/untranslatables` | The predecessor of markings, for laws still on schema v0.5.x |

Write actions on this dashboard are enforced by the admin API, not by the frontend.

## Development

```bash
just dev                    # full stack with hot reload; the editor is on http://localhost:3000
just dev-frontend editor    # only what the editor needs, against Keycloak; vite on :7300
```

`just dev-frontend` needs `.env.sso-local` (see [Auth and roles](/auth-and-roles/)). Running `npm run dev` in `frontend/` starts only Vite on port 3000 and proxies `/api`, `/auth` and `/health` to an editor-api on port 8000 (`API_PORT` overrides it).

## Deployment

The editor ships as one Docker image (`regelrecht-editor`) that bundles the built frontend with the editor-api binary, which serves the static files and the REST API. It runs on RIG/ZAD:

- **Production**: `editor.regelrecht.rijks.app`
- **PR previews**: for a pull request that carries the `deploy:preview` label
