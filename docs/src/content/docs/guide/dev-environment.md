## Architecture

`just dev` runs PostgreSQL in Docker and the application services natively.
It starts only what the chosen app needs:

| `just dev …` | Browser | Backend | PostgreSQL |
|---|---|---|---|
| `all` (default) | editor `:7300`, lawmaking `:7500` | editor-api `:8000`, admin API `:8001` | yes |
| `editor` | editor `:7300` | editor-api `:8000` | yes |
| `admin` | none (API only) | admin API `:8000` | yes |
| `lawmaking` | lawmaking `:7500` | none | no |

The browser only talks to Vite. Vite serves the frontend with hot module
replacement and proxies `/api`, `/auth` and `/health` to editor-api. The admin
API has no UI of its own: its dashboard is the editor's Corpusinwinning
section, which reaches it through editor-api's `/api/harvest-admin/*` proxy.
That section only works in `all`, where editor-api's `HARVEST_ADMIN_URL` points
at the local admin API; with `editor` alone those screens answer 503.

## One-Time Setup (build speed)

[Getting Started](./getting-started) lists the prerequisites. Then, once per
machine after cloning:

```bash
just dev-setup
```

It installs `sccache`, plus the [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold) linker
on x86_64 Linux (through apt, dnf or Homebrew, whichever it finds), and points every git
worktree at a single shared cargo `target-dir` so a new worktree reuses the
already-built dependency graph instead of cold-building from scratch. That
setting lands in a gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` at the root of the main
checkout.

When the repo is on a slow mount (9p/NFS/SMB, e.g. a WSL2 or Docker-Desktop
dev container backed by a Windows drive), it relocates that target dir to fast
local storage under `~/.cache/regelrecht/`, which is usually the biggest
build-time win. `sccache` is installed but left off locally (it disables
incremental compilation, which hurts the hot-reload loop); CI uses both.

Sharing that target dir has a cost when two worktrees build at once. Cargo
locks a target dir exclusively for the length of a build, so the second one
waits: `just validate` measured 2 seconds alone and 38 seconds next to a
45-second `just lint` in another worktree. Sharing still wins by a wide margin
when one build runs at a time (a first `just build-check` in a fresh worktree
took 1 second shared and 170 seconds with its own target dir). A worktree about
to run long builds can step out of the queue with `just target-isolated`, and
`just target-shared` puts it back. The measurements are at the top of
`script/target-dir.sh`.

sccache does not give you both. It hashes the working directory, so two
worktrees on different paths share no Rust compilation at all: a cold
`just build-check` with a warm cache gave 480 misses and 0 hits.

mold is the configured linker on x86_64 Linux (`packages/.cargo/config.toml`),
so builds there fail to link without it. On that platform `just dev` refuses to
start a Rust service when mold is missing. On macOS and aarch64 Linux cargo uses the default linker, and
neither `just dev-setup` nor the dev recipes ask for mold.

## Starting the Dev Stack

```bash
just dev             # everything (default)
just dev editor      # just the editor
just dev admin       # just the harvester-admin API, e.g. for pipeline work
just dev lawmaking   # just the lawmaking UI (no backend)
just dev-down        # stop it
```

The recipe checks prerequisites (docker, plus cargo and node where the app
needs them, and mold on x86_64 Linux), starts PostgreSQL and waits for it,
builds the engine WASM for the editor, installs frontend dependencies when they
are missing, and starts the services in the background. `just dev-frontend` is
an alias, from when the recipe had that name.

Notes:

- **Backends run once** via `cargo run`, not `cargo watch`; Vite keeps HMR for
  the frontend. After a backend change, stop and start the stack. Restarts after
  the first build are near-instant because the Rust artifacts are reused (see
  [One-Time Setup](#one-time-setup-build-speed)). `cargo watch` is not used
  because its recursive watch hangs on a 9p-mounted worktree.
- **The editor uses real SSO** against the central Keycloak, so `all` and
  `editor` need `.env.sso-local` (copy `.env.sso-local.example` and fill in the
  values, see [Auth and roles](/auth-and-roles/)). The default ports `7300` and `7500` are the redirect URIs already registered
  on the `regelrecht-local` Keycloak client. Override them with `EDITOR_PORT` /
  `LAWMAKING_PORT`.
- In a dev container where the native backend can't reach Postgres on
  `localhost`, set `DB_HOST=host.docker.internal` in `.env` for the admin API;
  editor-api takes that host from `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.sso-local`.
- Prometheus and Grafana are not part of `just dev`. See
  [Grafana](/components/grafana/#running-locally) to run them.

## Stopping

```bash
just dev-down
```

## Logs

```bash
tail -f .dev-admin.log           # Admin (harvester) API log
tail -f .dev-editor-api.log      # editor-api log
tail -f .dev-editor.log          # Editor Vite log
tail -f .dev-lawmaking.log       # Lawmaking Vite log
just dev-logs                    # PostgreSQL log
```

## Database Access

```bash
just dev-psql
```

## Full Docker Stack

For running everything in Docker without hot reload:

```bash
just local          # Start
just local-down     # Stop
just local-logs     # Logs
just local-psql     # Database access
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Optional overrides
POSTGRES_PORT=5433
DB_HOST=localhost
EDITOR_PORT=7300
LAWMAKING_PORT=7500
RUST_LOG=info
```

### Logging

Six binaries read these variables: editor-api, admin, poc-portal, and the three
pipeline binaries (harvest worker, enrich worker, pipeline API). The harvester CLI builds
its own subscriber and reads only `RUST_LOG`.

| Variable | Values | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RUST_LOG` | `tracing` filter | `info` (harvester CLI: `warn`) | Which events are emitted |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `text` (`plain`), `json` | `text` | Output format |
| `LOG_SPAN_EVENTS` | `none`, `close`, `new`, `active`, `full` | per service: `close` for editor-api, `none` elsewhere | Per-span timing lines |

`LOG_FORMAT=json` writes one JSON object per event. The event's own fields are
flattened to the top level; the enclosing spans are added as nested `span` and
`spans` keys, so a log backend can search per field. Set it per deployment in
ZAD; locally the text lines read better, so leave the variable unset. An
unrecognized value falls back to text and warns on stderr, so a typo never
silences logging.

## Architecture Explorer

`just arch-explore` builds and starts a local explorer of the codebase on port 7180 (override with `ARCH_EXPLORE_PORT`). It renders a model of the Rust workspace and the Vue frontends, from crate down to method and from app down to component, with the dependencies between them. The model comes from `packages/arch-extract/`, a developer tool that is not deployed. It is generated from the working tree on demand and never committed, so it cannot go stale; `just arch-generate` writes it to disk for inspection. `packages/arch-extract/README.md` explains how the edges are resolved and what the explorer misses.

## Code Guide

`just code-guide` builds and starts a guide to the Rust workspace on port 7190 (override with `CODE_GUIDE_PORT`). It shows how the code calls itself: crates and modules in reading order, the modules a module calls into and is called from, and for every type its methods with their signatures, doc comments, callers and callees, in any crate. The Graph view draws the call graph around what is open, one node per function: callers, callees or both to a chosen depth, with the paths between two functions highlighted and a choice of layouts.

Every relation is a call as rust-analyzer resolved it, so the guide needs an index first: `just code-guide-index` builds one in about a minute and caches it until a source, a Cargo file or the toolchain changes. Test code is left out. When files change after indexing, the guide names them and keeps showing their calls as indexed until the index is rebuilt, while the source viewer finds each function again in the current text. Every worktree keeps an index of its own. `packages/code-guide/README.md` says what counts as a call and what the index cannot see.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) (for example with
`uv tool install pre-commit`), then register the hooks in your clone:

```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
```

The `commit-msg` type matters. The Conventional Commits check on the commit
message runs at that stage, and a plain `pre-commit install` registers only the
`pre-commit` stage, so that check would never run locally.

On commit the hooks run, each only when a matching file changed:

- Trailing whitespace, end-of-file, merge-conflict and large-file checks
- YAML linting (yamllint, config in `.yamllint`)
- Rust formatting (`just format`) and clippy (`just lint`)
- Schema validation of corpus files (`just validate`)
- Licence information (`reuse lint`): every file needs a licence, set in
  `REUSE.toml` with the licence texts in `LICENSES/`. Code and text get the
  default by file type. An image, a font or a file type the list does not name
  fails the hook until it has its own entry with its rightsholder
- The test suites of the CI scripts and merge gates under `script/`, when that
  script or its workflow changed

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` has the full list. What to do when a hook fails is on
[Contributing](/operations/contributing#pre-commit-hooks).
