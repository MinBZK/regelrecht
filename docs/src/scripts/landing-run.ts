/*
 * Running the scenario for real, in the visitor's browser.
 *
 * This is the only execution the panel has. There was a recorded one beside it
 * for a while, rendered server-side so the panel was never empty, and it turned
 * out to be one execution too many: two traces of the same law, with different
 * step counts because they asked the engine different questions, two sets of
 * wording that both had to stay true, and two buttons a visitor could not tell
 * apart. On a page arguing that one law should have one execution, that was the
 * wrong shape. So: the engine runs here or the panel says nothing ran.
 *
 * The engine and the laws are about 600 KB gzipped, fetched when the panel
 * before this one scrolls into view and run when this one does. Not on page
 * load: a visitor who never reaches the panel never pays for it.
 *
 * Nothing here draws anything. It produces rows, and the player animates them.
