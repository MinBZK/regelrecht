//! Cache-Control policy for the editor's static files.
//!
//! The editor image has no nginx in front of it: `editor-api` is the web
//! server for `frontend/dist` as well as the API, so caching policy has to
//! be decided here or not at all. Until now it was not decided at all —
//! every response left without a `Cache-Control`, which makes a returning
//! visitor re-fetch the whole bundle or, at best, revalidate every file
//! one by one.
//!
//! Two classes, and the split is the whole point:
//!
//! * **Content-hashed bundle files** (`/assets/index-DkX9a2Bc.js`). The
//!   hash is derived from the contents, so the URL can never denote
//!   different bytes. These get a year plus `immutable`: no request at
//!   all on a repeat visit, not even a conditional one.
//! * **Everything else** — `index.html`, the SPA fallback for deep
//!   links, `favorites.json`, `regelrecht-icon.svg`. These live at fixed
//!   names and their contents do change, so they get `no-cache`:
//!   *revalidate before use*, not "never store". The browser keeps the
//!   body and a `304` confirms it, which is the cheap answer we want.
//!
//! Getting the split wrong in the immutable direction is expensive and
//! unfixable from the server side: a visitor holding a stale `immutable`
//! entry will not ask again for a year, and no deploy reaches them. So
//! the predicate below errs toward `no-cache` whenever a name does not
//! unambiguously carry a hash.
