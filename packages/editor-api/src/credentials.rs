//! One credential service for traject reads and writes.
//!
//! Every editor-api handler that touches a traject backend has to answer the
//! same question — *which* token authenticates this request, and what happens
//! when there is none* — and used to answer it by hand: a write-token
//! resolution, a separate read-token resolution, a loose writability gate, and
//! a `WriteContext { token_override: … }` built literally at the persist site.
//! Four steps, each independently forgettable: a new call-site that skipped one
//! still compiled and silently fell back to the service token (the bug class
//! behind the pr952 promote regression).
//!
//! [`TrajectCredentials`] folds those steps into two entry points —
//! [`TrajectCredentials::for_read`] and [`TrajectCredentials::for_write`] — plus
//! the two backend-less variants the index scan and the create-traject
//! preflight need. The write path returns a [`WriteAuthorization`], the **only**
//! way an editor handler puts a `token_override` into a [`WriteContext`]: the
//! writability gate (403) and the per-user token are resolved together, so they
//! can no longer drift apart.
//!
//! ## What the decision depends on
//!
//! * **writable-at-rest** — whether the target backend has its own write
//!   credential (a configured `CORPUS_AUTH_*` service token on the GitHub API
//!   backend, or a natively writable local dir). This is the
//!   [`writable`](crate::state::BackendEntry::writable) flag captured once at
//!   backend registration, **not** a runtime `RepoBackend::is_writable()` probe:
//!   the old code used `is_writable()` as a stand-in for "has a service token",
//!   overloading a method whose meaning could shift under it. Passing the
//!   registration-time capability in explicitly keeps the credential decision
//!   decoupled from what `is_writable()` happens to mean.
//! * **override-capability** — [`RepoBackend::supports_token_override`]: only a
//!   backend that authenticates each persist against GitHub can route a write
//!   through the acting user's own token. A local/clone backend that ignores the
//!   override must never be handed a per-user token (or demanded one).
//! * **requiredness** — whether this deployment routes writes through the acting
//!   user's own GitHub token (the `GITHUB_USER_TOKEN_REQUIRED` env var **or** the
//!   `github.user_oauth` feature flag). See [`write_requires_user_token`] and the
//!   deliberately-more-tolerant [`user_token_write_mode`].
//! * **the link state** — whether the caller has a valid / expired / absent
//!   sealed GitHub-token cookie riding on this request.
//!
//! ## Precedence, in one place
//!
//! A configured service token always wins: a backend that is writable at rest
//! keeps reading and writing with its own token, byte-identical to the
//! pre-user-token flow, even for a linked user. Rerouting working service-token
//! traffic through a personal token would 403 every member GitHub refuses on
//! that repo (no direct push access, or an org's OAuth-App access
//! restrictions). Only a token-less, override-capable backend — the traject
//! writable-own repo on a user-chosen repo, which has no service token *by
//! design* (fail-closed against shipping the central token to a user-picked
//! repo) — falls through to the user's own token, or the 428 connect-flow when
//! they haven't linked one.
