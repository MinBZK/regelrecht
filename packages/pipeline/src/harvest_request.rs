//! Canonical "request a harvest" entry point.
//!
//! Both HTTP layers that accept harvest requests (the editor-facing pipeline
//! API and the admin API) used to own divergent copies of this logic, with
//! different dedup, exhausted-law and bookkeeping semantics. This module is
//! the single implementation: advisory lock, dedup against active jobs, the
//! `harvest_exhausted` check, date validation, and law-entry bookkeeping
//! (upsert + status + job link) — all in one transaction, with every error
//! propagated instead of discarded.
//!
//! The worker's follow-up path (re-harvesting laws referenced by a completed
//! harvest) deliberately stays on
//! [`crate::job_queue::create_harvest_job_if_not_exists`]: it runs in a hot
//! loop over many laws and intentionally does no per-law status bookkeeping.
