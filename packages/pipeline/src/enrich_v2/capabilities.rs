//! What a step needs against what the runtime grants.
//!
//! The failure this module exists for is recorded in issue #1036 and was
//! measured in round 2 of the enricher archive. The enrichment prompt tells
//! the agent to read `law-mvt-research/SKILL.md` and search for parliamentary
//! documents; that skill declares `WebFetch` and `WebSearch`; the agent is
//! spawned with `Read,Edit,Write,Grep,Glob`. The instruction is therefore
//! impossible. Nothing compared the two, the step ran to a clean exit, and
//! what came back was a `kst-` citation with a URL for a document the agent
//! had not read. That the number happened to be right makes it worse: the
//! agent applied the "dossier number plus 3" convention, which holds often
//! enough to survive a spot check and fails silently on any dossier where
//! number 3 is the Council of State's advice.
//!
//! Removing the two offending lines from the prompt would fix this round and
//! nothing after it: the next skill edit reintroduces the mismatch silently.
//! So the comparison happens here, from the skill's own frontmatter, and it
//! produces one of three outcomes per step.
//!
//! A step whose own minimum is not granted cannot produce its artefact at
//! all. Where the step is required the chain fails and says why; where it is
//! optional it is left out of the prompt and recorded as left out, which is
//! the difference between a known gap and a silent one.
//!
//! A step whose minimum is granted while its skill asks for more is the
//! interesting case, and it is where `law-generate` sits: writing YAML needs
//! no shell, and the generate-validate-test loop in that skill needs `just`.
//! Cutting the loop out of the skill would be wrong, because the skill is
//! also used by hand where the shell does exist. Instead the prompt names the
//! part that cannot run here and says what takes its place, so the agent does
//! not report a validation it never performed.
