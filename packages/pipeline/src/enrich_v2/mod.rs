//! The parts of the enrichment flow that need no model: the checks, the
//! capability plan, the closure, the reference graph, the closing pass.
//!
//! The design constraint that shapes everything here is what the current
//! flow ran into: the agent is spawned without `Bash`, `WebFetch` and
//! `WebSearch`, so it cannot validate, cannot test, and cannot retrieve.
//! Every instruction in this flow is therefore written for an agent that
//! only reads what the worker put in front of it. The worker fetches, the
//! worker validates, the worker checks. The agent reads and writes.
//!
//! [`checks`] is the part that needs no model at all and runs today over any
//! law file. [`capabilities`] is the other half of that constraint: it
//! compares what a step needs against what the runtime grants, so an
//! instruction the agent cannot carry out is left out of the prompt instead
//! of being answered with an invention. `enrich.rs` drives one chain and
//! calls into this module at some twenty places.
