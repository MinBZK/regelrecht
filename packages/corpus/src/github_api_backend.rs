//! API-only [`RepoBackend`] implementation against the GitHub REST API.
//!
//! No local git clone, no `/tmp` working tree. Reads go straight through
//! the Contents API; writes buffer in memory and flush as one Contents
//! API PUT/DELETE per file in [`persist`]. The branch is created lazily
//! in [`ensure_ready`] when it doesn't yet exist on the remote
//! ("traject branch on first activation").
//!
//! ## Atomicity
//!
//! The Contents API commits each PUT/DELETE separately. All current
//! editor flows ([`save_law`], [`save_scenario`], [`delete_scenario`],
//! [`save_annotations`]) write exactly one file per persist, so they are
//! effectively atomic. A future multi-file save would need the Git Data
//! API (blob → tree → commit → ref update) to land both files in a
//! single commit; the implementation here would surface partial-failure
//! state.
//!
//! ## Optimistic concurrency
//!
//! Each pending write carries the blob SHA that was current when the
//! caller last read the file (or `None` if it was never read — e.g. a
//! brand-new file). On the PUT, GitHub returns 409 if the SHA is stale.
//! `persist` then re-reads the SHA and retries **once**; a second 409 is
//! surfaced as [`CorpusError::Conflict`] for the caller to deal with.
//! For `save_annotations`'s append-only flow this is safe because dedup
//! happens against the freshly-read base before re-writing.
