//! The `GithubClient` service: one shared `reqwest::Client`, one header
//! builder, one base-url mechanism, and the ETag + rate-limit state that the
//! stateful read paths need.
//!
//! State (ETag cache, last-seen rate-limit remaining) lives behind a
//! `std::sync::Mutex` so every method takes `&self` (interior mutability).
//! The lock is only ever taken to read/replace a small `HashMap` entry or an
//! `Option<u32>` — never held across a `.await` (clippy's `await_holding_lock`
//! guards this), so it can't stall the async runtime.
//!
//! ## Conditional GETs
//!
//! Two shapes of ETag state live here:
//!
//! * [`cached_etag`](GithubClient::cached_etag) / [`store_etag`](GithubClient::store_etag)
//!   — an ETag with **no body**, for the Trees read, whose caller keeps the
//!   previously loaded data itself and only needs to be told "unchanged"
//!   (`Ok(None)` on 304).
//! * [`cached_response`](GithubClient::cached_response) /
//!   [`store_response`](GithubClient::store_response) — an ETag **together
//!   with the payload it was observed with**, for the Contents reads, whose
//!   callers need the content back on a 304. Storing the two as one unit is
//!   what makes the 304 path safe: there is never an ETag whose body was
//!   dropped, so a 304 can never degrade into "empty" or "does not exist".
//!
//! Both caches are keyed per (url, token identity), so one principal's
//! entries do not answer another principal's reads. The token itself is
//! never stored, only a non-cryptographic digest of it — see
//! [`cache_key`](GithubClient::cache_key) for what that does and does not
//! guarantee.
//!
//! The response cache never serves content without asking GitHub first: it
//! only turns a 200 into a 304, which costs no rate-limit quota. It can
//! therefore not go stale — a changed file changes its ETag and comes back
//! as a full 200. Its size is capped ([`RESPONSE_CACHE_BUDGET_BYTES`]) so a
//! corpus-wide read sequence cannot grow it without bound; the least
//! recently used entries are evicted first.
