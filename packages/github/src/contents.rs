//! Contents API: read a file (raw or with its sha), list a directory, and
//! upsert / delete a file. Writes carry optimistic-concurrency semantics
//! (409 → [`GithubError::Conflict`]) and permission semantics (genuine 403 →
//! [`GithubError::WriteDenied`], rate-limit 403 stays generic).
//!
//! ## Absence versus failure
//!
//! The reads here answer "not there" as `Ok(None)` / an empty listing, and
//! callers act on that: a missing file is created, a missing directory has
//! no colliding names in it. So a *failure* dressed up as absence is not a
//! degraded read — it overwrites work.
//!
//! GitHub answers three different things with 404: a path that isn't in
//! the ref, a ref that doesn't exist, and a repo this credential cannot
//! see. The first two are absence — there is no content at that path
//! either way, and a traject branch that does not exist yet is a supported
//! state ("branch on first activation"). The third is a failure, and it is
//! indistinguishable from the other two by body: a repo you cannot see
//! answers the same `{"message":"Not Found"}` as a missing file, precisely
//! so it doesn't confirm the repo exists.
//!
//! So a 404 is only reported as absence once the **repository** has proven
//! readable with this credential — one repo lookup per (repo, token),
//! remembered after that. See `confirm_absence`. That a *ref* exists is
//! not this layer's question: the backends settle it in `ensure_ready`,
//! which is where a mistyped corpus branch has to fail loudly.
//!
//! ## Conditional GETs
//!
//! All three reads carry `If-None-Match` from the client's response cache,
//! which stores each ETag together with the body it belongs to. A 304 is
//! answered from that body, so it saves rate-limit quota (304s don't count)
//! without ever turning into an empty answer. A 304 arriving without a
//! cached body — the server ignoring the absence of our header — is retried
//! unconditionally rather than reported as "gone".
