//! Repository Activity API: the audit trail GitHub keeps of ref changes
//! (pushes, force pushes, branch creations and deletions) on a repository.
//!
//! One question is asked of it, and only on an error path: *was this branch
//! ever deleted?* That is the single in-band signal separating "the branch
//! was never created" from "the branch existed and is gone" — two states
//! that look identical to the Refs API (both are a 404) but call for very
//! different answers: initialise it, versus warn that work may be lost.
//!
//! Read access to the repository is enough for this endpoint, so the same
//! token that reads the corpus can ask the question.
