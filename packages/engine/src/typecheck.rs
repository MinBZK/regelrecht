//! Static type check of a law: nullability (RFC-036) and general typing
//! (RFC-037).
//!
//! A law declares the type of every parameter, input and output, and since
//! schema v0.5.8 also whether the field may be absent (`nullable`). The
//! declarations are claims the law makes about the world it reads and the
//! outcome it produces, and most of them can be held against the law's own
//! actions before it ever runs: a field that is never absent cannot usefully
//! be tested for absence, a value that may be absent cannot be added up
//! without first asking whether it is there, and an `IF` that says nothing
//! for the unmatched case cannot feed an output that promised an answer.
//! Finding these in the editor and in `just validate` is cheaper than finding
//! them as an `AbsentOperand` on one citizen's case.
//!
//! The checker only reports what it can know from the declarations. Objects
//! are untyped, so a property path `$x.y` has unknown type; a `FOREACH`
//! binding has unknown type and unknown nullability; a `MIN`/`MAX` over a
//! collection may be empty and so may be absent, which the checker cannot
//! see. "Unknown" means: make no claim. A finding on a correct law is a bug in
//! the rule.
//!
//! The rules, each pinned by a test:
//!
//! - **N1** `EQUALS`/`NOT_EQUALS`/`IS_NULL`/`NOT_NULL` against a literal
//!   `null`: the other side must be a field that may be absent.
//! - **N2** A literal `null` is written only as the value of a nullable
//!   output (directly, or through the branches of an `IF`), or as an element
//!   of a container literal (an item of `LIST`, the body of a `FOREACH`
//!   without `combine`): an array holding an absence is a value, and its
//!   elements are untyped anyway.
//! - **N3** An `IF` without `default` yields `null` when no case matches, so
//!   it is allowed only as the value of a nullable output.
//! - **N4** A value that may be absent enters arithmetic, ordering, logic, an
//!   `IF` condition or a date operation, or is assigned to an output that is
//!   never absent, only on a path where the law has established it is
//!   present. `EQUALS` and `IN` are not in that list: they are structural on
//!   an absence (RFC-036), so an absent subject is a defined `false` there,
//!   not an error. Nor is a `FOREACH` collection: a `null` collection
//!   iterates nothing (RFC-036). A path establishes presence through an
//!   absence test in a condition, through a boolean output that is such a
//!   test (`heeft_partner = NOT(EQUALS $partner null)`, referenced as
//!   `$heeft_partner`), and through a `FOREACH` filter for its body; a present
//!   field implies a present record.
//! - **N5** An input that takes another output must be nullable when that
//!   output is, and when the call that fetches it is skipped for a required
//!   parameter that may be null and that the target does not declare
//!   nullable. An article that implements a required open term without a
//!   default may not declare its output for the term nullable.
//! - **T1** Arithmetic and ordering operands are numbers (or amounts); `ADD`
//!   also concatenates strings and arrays, ordering also compares dates.
//! - **T2** Logical operands and `IF` conditions are booleans.
//! - **T3** `EQUALS` compares values of one type; `number` and `amount` are
//!   one type here, and so are `date` and `string`, since dates arrive as ISO
//!   strings.
//! - **T4** A literal assigned to an output has the output's type.
