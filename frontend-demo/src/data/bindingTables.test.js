/**
 * Every `kind: table` binding has to name a table and a column that the persona
 * data actually has. Nothing checked that before, and a typo is invisible:
 * `materialize` finds no row, the input resolves to unknown, and the law
 * reports a missing fact for a register that was never queried. The citizen
 * then sees "De wet kan nog geen uitkomst geven" for a value nobody can supply
 * — the form does not ask for it either, because a register input is not a
 * question.
 *
 * That is how `partner_buitenlands_inkomen` pointed at table `buitenlands`
 * (the table is `buitenlands_inkomen`) with column `inkomen` (the column is
 * `bedrag`): a citizen without a partner was told the huurtoeslag could not be
 * decided because his partner's foreign income was unknown.
