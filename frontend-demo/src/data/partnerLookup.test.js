/**
 * A `select_on` key has to be bound in the same law that does the lookup.
 *
 * `materialiseRecord` resolves a selector against that law's own parameters and
 * its own materialised inputs — nothing else. A law that selects rows on
 * `$partner_bsn` without binding `partner_bsn` therefore finds no key at all,
 * and every value behind it becomes unknown instead of absent.
 *
 * That is what blocked the huurtoeslag: twelve partner lookups in
 * `wet_inkomstenbelasting` selected on `$partner_bsn` while the binding for it
 * lived in `wet_brp`. A citizen whose own card said "Heeft partner: Nee" was
 * told the law could not decide because his partner's foreign income was
 * unknown — and the form could not ask for it either, because a register input
 * is not a question.
