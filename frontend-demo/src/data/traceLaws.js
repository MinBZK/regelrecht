/**
 * Which law each line of the engine's text trace belongs to.
 *
 * The presenter walks a trace law by law (zorgtoeslagwet, then the Zvw, then
 * the penitentiaire beginselenwet), and in two thousand lines of box drawing
 * the place where one law hands over to the next is hard to find. The engine
 * marks that place itself: `Evaluating rules for <law>` opens a law, and
 * `Reference: <law>#<output>` opens the law it reads from. Everything indented
 * below such a line runs inside that law, until the tree comes back out.
 *
 * Indentation is the column of the line's connector (`├ └ ╟ ╙`); a line that
 * has none (the root header) sits outside every scope. The format comes from
 * `render_node` in `packages/engine/src/trace.rs`.
