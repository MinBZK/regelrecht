// Takes `filterParams` from `useMarkings` so the backlog always describes the
// same set of markings as the list beside it. A count that groups something
// other than the visible rows is worse than no count: nothing about the page
// looks wrong while it happens.
//
// There is no paging. A backlog is short by construction, and truncating it
// would cut off the tail of single-marking clusters, which is the part worth
// looking at twice: `resolved_by` is free text, so two agents asking for the
// same change in different words land in two clusters of one.
