 * Nullability of a scenario value (RFC-036, schema v0.5.8).

 * the word `null`, a stated absence, is one of the field's values. The
 * scenario editor knows that declaration for a law's parameters and for the
 * external data-source columns of the dependency graph, and lets the author
 * state an absence only where the law allows one. A blank cell (no value
 * stated, unknown) is always allowed; that is a different thing from null.

 * unknown declaration makes no claim, the same rule the engine's type
