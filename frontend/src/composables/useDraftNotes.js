/**
 * useDraftNotes - local-only note authoring store (RFC-018 write path, MVP).
 *
 * Notes a user creates in the editor live in `localStorage`, keyed per law,
 * until they are written back. Two ways out: `exportYaml` produces a YAML
 * document for a manual commit (the original RFC-018 §10 MVP, still here for
 * the offline case), and `saveToRepo` PUTs that same document to editor-api,
 * which validates it and opens a PR against the chosen source - the same
 * traject branch+PR path law and scenario edits already use.
 *
 * Draft notes are merged into the resolved-notes list by the caller so they
 * highlight live, exactly like committed notes; they just carry an extra
 * `__draft` marker so the UI can show them as unsaved and offer delete/export.
