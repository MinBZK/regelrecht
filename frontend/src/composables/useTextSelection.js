/**
 * useTextSelection - selection offsets and the TextQuoteSelector build for
 * notes (RFC-018 write path).
 *
 * The note resolver works in code-point ("raw char") offsets while the DOM
 * and the DS text editor report UTF-16 offsets; cpToUtf16/utf16ToCp convert
 * between the two. buildSelector turns a raw [start,end) range into a W3C
 * TextQuoteSelector.
 *
 * Uniqueness: a bare `exact` often occurs many times ("verzekerde" appears
 * dozens of times in the Zorgtoeslagwet). The selector is only useful if it
 * resolves to exactly one span, so context is grown until the resolver
 * (`engine.resolveNote`) reports a single match, or we run out of article and
 * report it as still ambiguous so the UI can ask the user to select more.

/**
 * Build a TextQuoteSelector from a raw range, growing prefix/suffix context
 * until the resolver finds exactly the span the user selected.
 *
 * "Found" from the resolver is necessary but not sufficient: the resolver's
 * exact-match prefix/suffix check trims a one-char-slack window
 * (resolver.rs find_exact_matches), so when the same `exact` repeats and a
 * grown context happens to satisfy the trimmed comparison at the *other*
 * occurrence, the resolver returns `found` pointing at the wrong span. For a
 * legal-text product that silent mis-anchor is unacceptable, so a `found`
 * result is only accepted when the single match lands in the article the user
 * selected in, at exactly the offsets they selected. Otherwise context keeps
 * growing; if it never converges the status is reported as ambiguous so the
 * UI asks the author to extend the selection rather than persisting a note on
 * the wrong sentence.
 *
 * @param {string} rawText           the selected article's text
 * @param {{start:number,end:number}} range  raw char offsets into rawText
 * @param {string} lawId
 * @param {{ resolveNote: Function }} engine  loaded WASM engine
 * @param {string|number} articleNumber  the article `range` is in; the
 *        resolver returns article-relative offsets + article_number, so the
 *        match is verified against this
 * @param {string|null=} validFrom  `valid_from` of the law version on screen,
