/**
 * Color scheme picker — automatic (follows OS), light, or dark.
 *
 * Thin facade over the shared `useColorScheme`: the editor persists the
 * preference server-side (via `useUserSettings`) and falls back to localStorage
 * on 401/network errors, so the picker still works for anonymous users. The
 * `data-scheme` attribute on <html> (which the design system keys its dark
 * tokens off) is applied centrally by the shared `useColorScheme`, which this
 * facade feeds the server-backed persistence adapter into.
