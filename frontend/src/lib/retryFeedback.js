/**
 * retryFeedback — keep a retry's loading spinner on screen long enough to
 * register as feedback.
 *
 * A "Probeer opnieuw" button re-runs a fetch that flips a `loading` ref
 * true→false. When the retry fails again it can resolve within a frame, so
 * the spinner never paints and the error dialog snaps straight back — the
 * click feels dead, as if nothing happened. Holding the spinner for a short
 * floor on failure gives the user a visible "it tried again" beat.
 *
 * The floor applies ONLY on failure: a successful retry reveals the content,
 * which is its own feedback, so it should stay instant.
